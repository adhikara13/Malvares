# POOLRAT - North Korean Backdoor Malware

**POOLRAT** is a backdoor malware used by the North Korean hacking group **Gleaming Pisces** (aka Citrine Sleet). It mainly targets **Linux and macOS** systems, giving attackers remote access to run commands, steal files, and control infected machines. POOLRAT has been seen in crypto-related attacks, often hidden inside fake trading apps to trick users into downloading it.

A similar macOS backdoor, named **SIMPLESEA**, was discovered by **Mandiant** during the **3CX supply chain attack**. SIMPLESEA allows attackers to execute commands, transfer files, and control infected devices over HTTP. Both POOLRAT and SIMPLESEA are linked to North Korean threat actors, including the **Lazarus Group**.

POOLRAT saves its configuration to a hardcoded config file at `/etc/apdl.cf`, which is **XOR-encrypted** with the key `0x5E`. Using **CyberChef** or a **Python script**, we can extract and decrypt the content of this config file.

### **Python3**
You can use the Python script https://github.com/adhikara13/Malvares/blob/main/Linux/POOLRAT/config_extractor.py to decrypt POOLRATâ€™s configuration file.  
- By default, it will try to extract the config from **`/etc/apdl.cf`**.  
- You can also specify a different file using the **`--file`** flag.
